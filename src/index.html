      <p id="source-text">A central line is a narrow tube inserted by a doctor into a large vein of a patient's neck or chest to give important medical treatment. When not put in correctly or kept clean, central lines can become an easy way for germs to enter the body and cause serious infections in the blood. These infections are called Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSIs), and they can be deadly.</p>

      <p>Data about infections in Georgia hospitals is collected by the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/">National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)</a> at the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (CDC). It is the nation’s most widely-used system for tracking healthcare-associated infections. The system now serves 11,000 medical facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis centers, surgery centers and others.</p>

    <div id="sri-text" class="textblock">
      <h3>Standardized Infection Ratio</h3>
      <p>To arrive at the standardized infection ratio, or SIR, the government calculates the number of infections that are predicted at a given hospital and compares that to the reported number. How does it figure out how many infections would be expected? This is based on benchmark rates from the years 2006 to 2008 for CLABSI and SSI, and from 2009 for CAUTI. The kinds of patients a hospital serves also is a factor.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>If the SIR is 1:</strong> the number of infections reported is the same as the number of predicted infections.</li>
        <li><strong>If the SIR is less than 1:</strong> there were fewer infections reported than predicted given the baseline data.</li>
        <li><strong>If the SIR is greater than 1:</strong> there were more infections reported than predicted given the baseline data.</li>

      <h3>Limitations To The Data</h3>
      <ul id="caveats">
        <li><strong>Limited reporting periods.</strong> We are reporting hospital-specific information on two newly available measures: catheter-associated urinary tract infections and surgical site infections for colon surgeries.  This information is based on just nine months of data covering January 1, 2012, to September 30, 2012. Three quarter’s worth of data may not fully represent a hospital’s typical performance. Additional data will continue to be rolled out to the public throughout the year, making these measures more reliable. The information on central line-associated bloodstream infections is stronger because it contains a full year’s worth of reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Time lags in reporting.</strong> The infection data available may not represent what’s currently happening in a hospital. Data is usually released about a year after hospitals begin reporting it, so conditions may have changed.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation.</strong> The National Healthcare Safety Network, the CDC’s system that collects this data, is highly respected. But even those who run it would like to see more validation of the data to make sure hospitals are accurately reporting their figures. Deciding which cases to report can be complicated, and this is a new effort for many hospitals. While some states have programs to validate this information, Georgia’s public health officials are just now trying to get such a program off the ground.</li>
